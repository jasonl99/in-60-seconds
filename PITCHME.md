## Basic Sorting

Most languages have a simple method of sorting a list of data.

In ruby, for exampe, 

```ruby
values = [1,6,2,9,0]
values.sort
```



## Sort By Precision 

XBRL, as it turns out, can have multiple values for _the same exact fact_.  For example, there might be a note
that revenue was $1.2 million, but the income statement shows $1,232,600.
